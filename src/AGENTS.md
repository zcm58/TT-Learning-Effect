Instructions for codex: 

This is a customtkinter based application to simplify the analysis of one specific project. It is intentionally
niche. Ensure that the code is well-structured, with clear comments and modular functions to facilitate understanding 
and future modifications. No code files should ever get larger than 400 lines - separate lengthy files into 
smaller modules as needed. Import them into the main LearningEffectAnalysis.py file as needed. 

Keep the GUI code completely separate from the analysis code. Ensure that different features are modular and
are added in separate files. Add detailed docstrings to each function and class, explaining their purpose assuming
the reader has no prior knowledge of the codebase.
