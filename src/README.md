This repo will hold all the files we'll need to compare the first 25 trials to the final 25 trials of the Table Tennis data. 

We'll also be able to use this tool to compare First 10 Wins vs Last 10 Wins, or First 10 Losses vs Last 10 Losses, etc. 

## Running Tests

The unit tests live in the `tests/` directory. Install dependencies and run the suite with:
