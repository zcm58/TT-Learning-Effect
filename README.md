# TT-Learning-Effect

This project provides a simple GUI for analyzing learning effects in table tennis data. The tool compares different sets of trials, such as the first 25 vs. the last 25 trials or the first 10 wins vs. the last 10 wins.

## Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

Launch the graphical interface with:

```bash
python src/LearningEffectAnalysis.py
```

The application will open a window that allows you to choose analysis options and export results.

For a short description of the underlying scripts, see [src/README.md](src/README.md).
